üöÄ Excited to share a recent project with the community! I've been working on a notification system using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Here's a rundown:

üîî Notification System Overview:

I've built a flexible notification system capable of displaying various types of notifications (info, warning, error, success) with customizable text, background colors, and icons. The notifications are displayed in a sleek, animated container at the bottom left of the screen. Each notification includes a progress bar indicating its lifespan and a close button for user interaction.


üõ†Ô∏è Key Features & Technologies:

Dynamic Creation: Notifications are dynamically generated and added to the notification container, with support for multiple simultaneous notifications.

Customization: Users can specify the type of notification (info, warning, error, success) along with the text and background color.

Animation & Interaction: Smooth animations are applied to both the appearance and disappearance of notifications. Users can pause/resume notification animations by hovering over them.
